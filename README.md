I used various machine learning techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, and GLM models to analyze soccer player salaries, capturing variations within countries and clubs. T
his ensured accurate salary predictions by considering unique country and club contexts.


Soccer Player Salary Prediction Project
Problem Description
This project focuses on predicting soccer player salaries based on various player statistics. By analyzing data from top clubs worldwide, the goal is to uncover the factors influencing player earnings, including positions, clubs, age, and performance metrics.

Research Questions
What player statistics help predict a player's salary?
Which factors influence a playerâ€™s goal-scoring ability?
Is there variance across different leagues in Europe and the USA? How do different playing positions affect salary?
Dataset
The dataset contains information on soccer players' performance from leading clubs globally. It encompasses 225 rows and 47 columns, comprising categorical and continuous variables. For detailed information, refer to Appendix A - Variable Descriptions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted using Python and Tableau, revealing significant insights such as outliers affecting salary, non-normal distribution of salaries, and variations in salaries across different clubs and playing positions.

Analysis Summary
1. Predicting Player Salaries:
Significant Predictors: Age, Red_Cards, Progressive_Passes, Shots_Attempted, Shots_On_Target, Take_Ons_Attempted, Club affiliations, and Governing Country affiliations.
Interpretation: Older players tend to earn more. Assists, progressive passes, and shots on target positively impact salary. Surprisingly, more red cards also relate to higher earnings, indicating potential factors affecting player value.
2. Factors Influencing Goal-Scoring:
Variables: Age, Assists, Yellow_Cards, Red_Cards, Expected_Goals, Progressive_Carries, Touches.
Insights: Younger players with more assists, higher expected goals, and increased touches tend to score more.
3. League and Position Impact on Salary:
Variance Analysis: Around 28% of salary variation is due to differences between clubs.
Covariance Insights: Associations between clubs and specific positions, indicating varying valuations.
Conclusion
Salary Prediction: Key factors impacting salaries include age, performance metrics, and club/governing country affiliations. Clubs should focus on these aspects during negotiations.

Goal-Scoring Factors: Youth, assists, and player involvement strongly influence goal-scoring abilities. Clubs can nurture these traits for offensive prowess.

League and Position Dynamics: Variability in salaries across clubs emphasizes unique valuation philosophies. Understanding these differences aids strategic recruitment.

Future Work
Incorporate additional variables (playing time, opposition quality) for deeper analysis.
Explore non-linear models for predicting salaries and goal-scoring abilities.
Investigate club-specific strategies influencing player valuations further.
